# Echo_Model
A basic computer-coded Echo Model that can be  applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios as possible
This is a python program. You can directly run the "echo.py", and you will see the process of agents evolution.
1. 'agent.py' is a class of the adaptive agent, which define the features and the interactive methods.
2. 'echo_model.py' define the interactions between the agents, we only realizes resource exchange between agents according to the sequence matching.

3. We retain three features:
  (1) the simple string-specified structure 
  (2) reproduction limited by resource acquisition(implicit fitness)
  (3) interaction mediated by tags
